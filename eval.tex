\section{Experimental evaluation}
We evaluate the performance of FlashMatrix and the R implementations of
the machine learning algorithms on FlashMatrix.

We conduct experiments on a non-uniform memory architecture machine with
four Intel Xeon E7-4860 processors, clocked at 2.6 GHz, and 1TB memory of
DDR3-1600. Each processor has 12 cores. The machine has three LSI SAS 9300-8e
host bus adapters (HBA) connected to a SuperMicro storage chassis, in which
24 OCZ Intrepid 3000 SSDs are installed. The 24 SSDs together are capable of
delivering 12 GB/s for read and 10 GB/s for write at maximum. The machine runs
Linux kernel v3.13.0. We use 48 threads for our in-memory and semi-external
implementation.
