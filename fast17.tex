% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
FlashMatrix executes R code for machine learning and statistics 
in parallel and out-of-core automatically.
%so that 
%their programs scale beyond the boundaries of system memory and 
%run faster than optimized, compiled C++ and Fortran implementations.
%
%FlashMatrix is a matrix-oriented programming framework for general data analysis
%with a high-level functional programming interface; i.e.~, it makes users R
%implementations of machine learning and statistics algorithms access 
%optimized, parallelized implementations of 
%
%
It scales matrix operations
beyond memory capacity by utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) in a non-uniform
memory architecture (NUMA). It provides a small number of generalized 
operations (GenOps) upon which we reimplement a large fraction of the dense 
matrix functions of the R framework. FlashMatrix evaluate matrix operations
lazily and fuses them with two-level partitioning to reduce data movement
between CPU and SSDs. 
%that require some functions to define the computation on
%elements of the input matrices. It reimplements
% a large number of matrix operations in the R framework with GenOps to execute R code in
%parallel and out of core automatically. 
%The functions passed to GenOps
%are vectorized to reduce the overhead of function calls. 
%We implement many of the top machine learning algorithms in R to benchmark
%the performance of FlashMatrix.
% learning Performance meets or exceeds optimized C implementations.
%When scaling beyond memory capacity on a large parallel machine, 
On a variety of machine learning and statistics algorithms,
out-of-core execution has minimal overhead when compared with the in-memory execution
for billion-scale datasets.
%in FlashMatrix has performance comparable
%to in-memory execution on a billion-scale dataset. 
In-memory and out-of-core execution outperform the in-memory execution of
Spark MLlib by a factor of 3 to 10.
