Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) defines a small set of vector and
matrix operations commonly used in scientific computing. There exist a few
high-optimized BLAS implementations such as MKL \cite{mkl}, OpenBLAS
\cite{openblas}, GotoBLAS \cite{Goto} and ATLAS \cite{atlas}. However, these
libraries optimizes the vector and matrix operations in shared memory and BLAS
only provides a small number of vector and matrix operations.

To further speed up computation and scale to larger vector and matrices,
several distributed memory matrix computation libraries are implemented
\cite{trilinos, petsc, elemental}. These libraries are in general built on
top of BLAS libraries and distribute computation with MPI. Like BLAS, these
libraries provide a limited set of matrix operations.

There are many distributed data processing frameworks.
MapReduce \cite{mapreduce} is a general large-scale data processing framework.
It provides a single primitive with two user-defined functions written with
low-level programming languages such as C/C++ and Java. Due to the lack of
efficient primitives for varieties of data access patterns, algorithms
implemented in MapReduce is usually less efficient. Dryad \cite{dryad} is
another general-purpose distributed execution framework for large-scale data
analysis. It provides more primitives than MapReduce to access various data
access patterns efficiently. Naaid \cite{naaid} is another distributed execution
engine that supports efficient batch processing, stream processing and iterative
and incremental computation in a single system.

Due to complexity of programming in the distributed execution engines, many
programming frameworks have been developed on top of the execution engines.
Pig Latin \cite{pig} and FlumeJava \cite{flumejava} are two systems built
on top of MapReduce to provide users a high-level operations for general-purpose
data analysis. SystemML \cite{systemml} is a system built on top of MapReduce
with a focus on large-scale machine learning.
DryadLINQ \cite{dryadlinq} is built on top of Dryad and exposes a high-level
language to express data analysis tasks.
