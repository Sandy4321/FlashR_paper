\begin{abstract}
R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistics and machine
learning, but it is slow and unable to scale to large
datasets. The general approach for having an efficient algorithm in R is to
implement it in C or FORTRAN and provide an R wrapper. FlashR accelerates
and scales existing R code by parallelizing
a large number of matrix functions in the R \textit{base} package and
scaling them beyond memory capacity with solid-state drives (SSDs).
FlashR performs memory hierarchy aware execution to speed up parallelized
R code by
	\textit{(i)} evaluating matrix operations lazily,
	\textit{(ii)} performing all operations in a DAG in a single execution
	and with only one pass over data to increase the ratio of computation to I/O,
	\textit{(iii)} performing two levels of matrix partitioning and reordering
	computation on matrix partitions to reduce data movement in the memory hierarchy.
We evaluate FlashR on various machine learning and statistics algorithms
on inputs of up to four billion data points. Despite the huge performance
gap between SSDs and RAM, FlashR on SSDs closely tracks the performance
of FlashR in memory for many algorithms. The R implementations
in FlashR outperforms H$_2$O and Spark MLlib by a factor of $3-20$.
