\begin{abstract}
R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistics and machine
learning, but the R framework is relatively slow and unable to scale to large
datasets. The general approach for speeding up an implementation in R is to
implement the algorithms in C or FORTRAN and provide an R wrapper. FlashR takes
a different approach: it executes R code in parallel and scales the code beyond
memory capacity by utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) automatically. It
provides a small number of generalized 
operations (GenOps) upon which we reimplement a large number of
matrix functions in the R \textit{base} package. As such, FlashR parallelizes
and scales existing R code with little/no modification. To reduce data movement
between CPU and SSDs, FlashR evaluates matrix operations lazily, fuses
as many matrix operations as possible in a single execution, and uses cache-aware,
two-level matrix partitioning.
We evaluate FlashR on a variety of machine learning and statistics algorithms 
on inputs of up to four billion data points.
FlashR out-of-core closely tracks the performance of FlashR in-memory.
The R code for machine learning algorithms executed in FlashR
outperforms the in-memory execution of H$_2$O and Spark MLlib by a factor of
$3-20$ and outperforms Revolution R Open by more than an order of magnitude.
